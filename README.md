### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

- I used a simple flex layout with just 2 sections so that the layout could easily be changed for desktop view
- Once I had the structure and the basic styling in place I then tackled the functionality of the form validation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you can't use the css position property on input elements.
I also learnt that a good README should be written alongside the development process - rather than after - something I will try to implement better next time!

### Useful resources

- [Javascript form tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form/) - This really helped me sort out the structure and logic of the form validation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
